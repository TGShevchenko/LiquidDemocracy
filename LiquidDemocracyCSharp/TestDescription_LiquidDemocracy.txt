The test solution is implemented in C# .NETCore. 
The solution consists from the following interfaces and classes:

<<<<< Interfaces:

IVoter - Interface for a Voter class
IVoterController - Interface for a VoterController class
IPrinter - Interface for a Printer class

<<<<< Classes:

Voter - Class that represents a Voter with corresponding operations: 
        Pick - to pick a choice and DelegateTo to delegate to another Voter
VoterController - A controller class that manipulates the voters collection
UserInputCOntroller - Decodes the use input and extracts the commands for voters
Printer - Prints votes' names and choices
FindVoterResult - Auxiliary class-storage to keep the found Voter result
Program - Main program class

<<<<<< Tests:

VoteTests - Contains 5 tests, which test the following:
AddVoterWithChoiceTest - A single choice
AddVoterWithDelegateTest - A single delegate
AddVoterWithChoiceAndDelegateTest - One choice and one delegate
GetAggregatedVoterChoicesForValidVotesTest - Creates valid and invalid choices with checking only valid ones
GetAggregatedVoterChoicesForInValidVotesTest - Creates valid and invalid choices with checking only invalid ones
