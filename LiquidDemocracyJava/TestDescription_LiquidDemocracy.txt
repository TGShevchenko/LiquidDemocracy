The test solution is implemented in Java. 
The solution consists from the following interfaces and classes:

<<<<< Interfaces:

IVoter - Interface for a Voter class
IVoterController - Interface for a VoterController class
IPrinter - Interface for a Printer class

<<<<< Classes:

Voter - Class that represents a Voter with corresponding operations: 
        Pick - to pick a choice and DelegateTo to delegate to another Voter
VoterController - A controller class that manipulates the voters collection
UserInputController - Decodes the use input and extracts the commands for voters
Printer - Prints votes' names and choices
FindVoterResult - Auxiliary class-storage to keep the found Voter result
Main - Main program class

<<<<<< Tests:

VoterControllerTest - Contains 5 tests, which test the following:

addVoterWithChoiceTest - A single choice
addVoterWithDelegateTest - A single delegate
addVotersWithChoicesAndDelegatesTest - Multiple choices and delegates. 
checkAddedVoters - Checks added voters
getInvalidVotesNumberTest - Checks the number of invalid choices
